<h1 title="Header"> Reflection On The Odin Project</h1>
<p id="first-paragraph">The Odin Project provides a free open source coding curriculum that can be taken entirely online. Since it's inception, it has helped many students get hired as developers and has assisted 
    countless others learn enough programming to work on their own personal projects.</p>
<div class="list">
<p id="PL">odin project is highly recommended for a number of reasons</p> 
<br>
<ul>
<li>The Odin Project makes you set up an actual environment on your computer where you learn how to actually write code.</li>
<ol>
<li>it makes you download a coding friendly OS (linux)</li>
<li>it teaches you how to use the terminal,heroku,git and github</li> 

</ol>
<li>Unlike other coding websites, <u title="The odin Project">TOP</u> doesn't babysit you through the course</li>

</ul>
